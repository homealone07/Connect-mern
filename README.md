# Smart E-business for SMEs

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the country’s economy. They make up more than 98% of all businesses that provide two out of three private sector jobs in the region. Being a small business owner is not a simple game to play but it’s a long run on an arcade filled with unexpected hurdles. It is a lifestyle of constant tension and pressure due to business problems but when rightly managed, there is an enormous reward waiting ahead. It is much needed for small or medium enterprises to start having an independent website site so that everyone can adapt to the trending technology, and they will reach the customer. 

In our project, we develop a web application where all small enterprises and medium enterprises register and upload all the product details and make them available to the customers. Our project will also provide analysis and analytics of the products and management of capital of the enterprise.

The whole development process is basically divided into two parts: 
    •	Front-end development and 
    •	Back-end development. 
    •	Database design 
These topics are discussed, with an emphasis on relational connectivity. This method of developing an e-commerce website can be easily replicated when developing an e-commerce website in developing or underdeveloped countries where computing resources are scarce and expensive due to socio-economic conditions. 

Our study examines the key determinants of an effective website. A literature review revealed that the top categories of determining factors were page load speed, business content, navigation efficiency, security, and marketing/customer centricity. The relative importance of each category was determined by counting the number of citations in the literature and conducting a survey to gather opinions of 
e-commerce customers and potential customers. The reported research is exploratory and aims to identify key issues perceived by various user groups. The main results showed that experts and consumers differed greatly in what they considered the most important factors.

##Methodology

Looking at the current status of the local SMEs, we have come up with an outgrowing internet utility - “Connect”. In our internet utility, all small agency and medium companies sign in and add all the product and offerings info that they need for clients. For merchandise kind companies we're designing an internet ordering gadget in order that clients order from the internet utility. For provider-kind companies, we're advertising their income and offerings to the clients. So that clients engage with our utility and could touch the kind of provider that they need. For the Enterprises stop we're displaying the evaluation of the product/offerings from the information accumulated from the clients. From the evaluation of the product, we are able to offer analytics to the Enterprises for the boom in their business enterprise and economic control of the SMEs.  
We have fragemented our project into 3 parts :
    1)	As a portal for collaborating with the SMEs and their targeted audience 
              we develop a web application where all small enterprises and medium enterprises register and upload all the product details and make them available to                 the customers. Our project will also provide analysis and analytics of the products and management of capital of the enterprise.
    2)	As a Business Consulting Services:
              As people start using our app for checking out the services from small-scale vendors and over time, we have a huge collection of data and analysis (like               where most people need the services and there is more demand, etc), with this data we can help with any services with accurate details of pricing and                   demand and in return, we can charge the consulting fees.
    3)	As a monetizing model:
              we charge small-scale employees for using our portal.
              
#Conclusion
E-commerce has completely transformed our lifestyles because we no longer need to spend time and money traveling to the market. Using e-commerce application development and web development solutions, a person can accelerate the growth of his online business. E-commerce development has made it feasible to minimize the cost of promoting items and services, making it one of the least expensive ways to conduct business.
There are no temporal constraints on the sale of the merchandise. Even at midnight, one can access the Internet and sell things with a single mouse click. In the case of an online store, a website that is dynamic, user-friendly, and targeted can produce strong sales.

Since the end of the 1980s, one of the most fundamental and significant developments to the global economy has been the proliferation of digital and online ICT. The outlook for at least the next 15 years, consumers are anticipated to be increasingly mobile and online. This will effectively necessitate that firms who wish to attract and retain their customers use digital internet technologies and actively engage in e-commerce, e-business, social-CRM, and e-marketing. We may also anticipate a push for more "e-government" tactics, in which corporate and community involvement with government agencies will occur via web-based platforms. 
Therefore, we believe that large corporations should invest more in e-commerce research and development. Any small or medium-sized enterprise (SME) that fails to implement ICT technologies and participate effectively in the digital economy runs the risk of becoming marginalized and at great peril
